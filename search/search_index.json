My broad research interests cover from revealing fundamentals of geophysical flows in coastal regions to solving coastal engineering problems with advanced modelling techniques in fluid mechanics. I am deeply fascinated by the rigorous math in theoretical fluid mechanics and attracted by the advance techniques and beautiful results in experimental fluid mechanics. Things are more interesting if my research can either reveal the fundamental physics of the nature or create practical value for engineering applications. I like to combine any research methods to study an interesting topic, rather than finding a topic that suits a certain research method.   A key challenge in coastal engineering is that the problem often involves multiple spatial and temporal scales, and usually the small-scale physics determines the large-scale phenomenon. My research follows the philosophy that one should first investigate small-scale physics and then use the scientific understanding to derive simple-yet-realistic models for large-scale applications. </p>"},{"location":"People/#post-doc-research-fellow","title":"Post-Doc Research Fellow","text":"<p> Dr. Wei Zheng \uff08\u97e6\u5f81\uff09</p> <p>2022-current</p> <p>I graduated from China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing) with a PhD in Civil engineering.

Currently, the research on PFB mainly focuses on demonstrating the conceptual design through laboratory experiments, but there is a lack of numerical tools that is critical for bringing these ideas to applications. To close this gap, we extended the existing volume-averaged numerical model for fixed porous body to floating scenarios mainly by using the relative velocity in the porous friction force, and developed a new openFOAM solver. As a demonstration, the developed model was applied to a various new designs of PFB proposed by our group. Through numerical simulations and flume experiments, we investigated the key design considerations of PFB, including cross sectional area, submergence, porosity, size of porous element, etc. We found that the proposed PFB can be 50% smaller than box- or pontoon-type breakwater.

Their presence significantly damps the local flow and therefore can be used for scour protection of offshore wind monopiles. Although this concept appears feasible, the underlying flow-sediment process is very complex and has yet been systematically investigated. In order to fill in the gap, a set of fixed-bed flume experiments were conducted to reveal the hydrodynamic details of typical ARs. In parallel, a set of live-bed tests with the same model setup were conducted to demonstrate the AR\u2019s efficiency in scour protection. High-fidelity numerical simulations of flow over AR array placed around a pile were also conducted to obtain the bottom shear stress, which is a key physical quantity for interpreting scour phenomena. With ARs placed tightly around a monopile, they can greatly reduce the local flows that induce scour, i.e., Ars almost eliminate the downward flow on the upstream side of the monopile and reduces the magnitude and unsteadiness of wake flow velocity by 50\u223c80%. The ARs can reduce the upstream and downstream scour depth by up to 100%, if edge scour can be reasonably managed.

Wave overtopping can be a potential threat to these pedestrians. In the context of global climate change, we expect to see rising sea level and harsher wave conditions in Singapore coastal regions, so it is unclear whether the existing seawalls will be sufficiently safe for allowing public accesses in the future. We also need to know how new seawalls can be better designed to achieve a balance between ensuring safety and reducing construction cost. </p> <p> Our group studied the allowable wave overtopping conditions regarding people\u2019s safety through quantitative model predictions. Here the risk is defined as people losing balance under flow impact, and the research work is targeted on typical seawalls in Singapore, e.g. with a 1:3 frontal slope. Under this project, we used a numerical model that can precisely simulate the process from wave shoaling to overtopping-human interaction. In addition, physical model tests were conducted using the state-of-the-art facilities at the hydraulic lab of CEE @ NUS. This model enables developing a probabilistic risk-analysis framework for people\u2019s safety under overtopping flows. A risk framework is proposed to quantify the probability of risk occurrence for different people groups (e.g. children) and different locations on the seawall (distance to the seafront edge). With this risk-analysis framework and the projected future sea levels and wave conditions, we can investigate how climate change affects wave overtopping and propose risk mitigation strategies (for instance, new designs of seawall or restricting people\u2019s access during certain wave conditions). </p>"},{"location":"Projects/#hydrodynamics-and-sediment-transport-for-wave-induced-sand-ripples","title":"Hydrodynamics and sediment transport for wave-induced sand ripples \uff08\u6c99\u7eb9\u6d77\u5e8a\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u4e0e\u8f93\u6c99\u673a\u7406\u7814\u7a76\uff09","text":"<p>Funding: </p> <p>Wave boundary layer streaming over rippled seabed (PI, \u00a5:300,000, State Key Research Laboratory of Hydroscience and Hydraulic Engineering, China, 2022.1-2022.12)</p> <p>Full-scale experimental study of sediment transport by oscillatory flows and currents (PI, S$ 180,000, Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, 2015.4-2017.3)</p> <p>Sand ripples generated by water waves are commonly observed in the coastal area, and their existence complicates the local sediment transport, but very few detailed full-scale experiments on this topic is available in the literature.

A thorough understanding of this combined wave-current boundary layer is a prerequisite for the prediction of currents, i.e. circulation, as well as sediment transport in coastal waters. We conducted a variety of experiments of turbulent wave-current boundary layer flows using the oscillatory water tunnel at NUS for flow generations and a Particle Image Velocimetry system for velocity measurements. Meanwhile, a semi-analytical model which adopts a rigorous way to account for a time-varying turbulent eddy viscosity is developed to interpolate experimental results. Many interesting features of turbulent wave-current boundary layer is discovered and neatly interpreted by the theoretical model. We manage to show that turbulence asymmetry streaming is an important factor for wave-current interaction, which is not considered in many models we know. We also investigate the effect of wave irregularity on wave-current boundary layer. Through comparative experiments, we confirmed the validity of the assumption of an equivalent regular wave for irregular-wave-current interaction. We also showed that the wave-by-wave approach is mostly valid for studying boundary layers under individual waves.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Publications/","title":"Publications \uff08\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u8868\uff09","text":""},{"location":"Publications/#journal-publications","title":"Journal Publications (\u671f\u520a\u8bba\u6587)","text":""},{"location":"Publications/#2024","title":"2024","text":"<p>Cao, D., Lin, Z., Yuan, J., Tan, W., &amp; Chen, H.
